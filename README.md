# The-Influence-of-Including-a-Dog-in-Dating-App-Profiles-on-Perceived-Attractiveness
In this experiment, our team would like to know if having a pet dog in a dating app profile photo leads to more swipes.For the control group, we had images of males without their pet dogs, and for treatment group, we had the same males with their pet dogs. We used "between-subjects design", so participants were either shown the 11 treatment profiles or all 11 of the control profiles. We calculated profile attractiveness by finding how many 'yes' each profile got. We then ran simple regression on all the profiles to determine the treatment effect and found that profiles with a dog had a significant ATE of 0.273 with strong statistical power, suggesting that, overall, having a pet dog in a dating app profile does increase the acceptance rate.
